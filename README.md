## Starting the defi project

```
git clone https://github.com/ZetiAi/defi.git
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```
pnpm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
